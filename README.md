## Things I would improve upon if I had more time

* I would have used Typescript.  I started with Typescript but it was taking longer time than I had
* More tests
* Include more features to build out more validation tests

## If this were to go to production
* Instead of creating the validation library I had I would have used a state machine, specifically XState to manage all form states.
* Separated out the components a bit further

## To run
* `npm install && npm run start
*
* To run tests `npm run test`
